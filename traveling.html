I love to see new places and try new things. This past summer, I went to Italy on a foreign exchange trip.
I stayed with a family in southern Italy near a city called Bari. I really enjoyed going to the beach and eating lots of new foods.
I also got to see Rome and all of the beautiful architecture and history there. I also visited Greece and Amsterdam when I was younger.
I loved the interesting buildings in Amsterdam and the Anne Frank House. My favorite place I've visited in the U.S is Chicago.
I really like all of the history there and all of the things you can do.
